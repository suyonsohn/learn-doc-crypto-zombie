// Constructors: function Ownable() is a constructor, which is an optional special function that has the same name as the contract. It will get executed only one time, when the contract is first created.

// Function Modifiers: modifier onlyOwner(). Modifiers are kind of half-functions that are used to modify other functions, usually to check some requirements prior to execution. In this case, onlyOwner can be used to limit access so only the owner of the contract can run this function. We'll talk more about function modifiers in the next chapter, and what that weird _; does.

// So the Ownable contract basically does the following:
// When a contract is created, its constructor sets the owner to msg.sender (the person who deployed it)
// It adds an onlyOwner modifier, which can restrict access to certain functions to only the owner
// It allows you to transfer the contract to a new owner

/**
 * @title Ownable
 * @dev The Ownable contract has an owner address, and provides basic authorization control
 * functions, this simplifies the implementation of "user permissions".
 */
contract Ownable {
    address public owner;

    event OwnershipTransferred(address indexed previousOwner, address indexed newOwner);

    /**
    * @dev The Ownable constructor sets the original `owner` of the contract to the sender
    * account.
    */
    function Ownable() public {
        owner = msg.sender;
    }

    /**
    * @dev Throws if called by any account other than the owner.

    modifier onlyOwner() {
        require(msg.sender == owner);
        _;
    }

    /**
    * @dev Allows the current owner to transfer control of the contract to a newOwner.
    * @param newOwner The address to transfer ownership to.
    */
    function transferOwnership(address newOwner) public onlyOwner {
        require(newOwner != address(0));
        OwnershipTransferred(owner, newOwner);
